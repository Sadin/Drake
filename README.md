### About

An IRC bot written in D.

Drake is a basic IRC bot that im working on to coincide with myself learning [Dlang](http://dlang.org/ ). As my knowledge of the D language grows I will do my best to expand upon Drake and make its features and source code reflect said knowledge.

### Dependencies

To install required dependencies in the project directory run dub and you should be good to go. For instructions on installing dub on your system see [code.dlang.org/download](http://code.dlang.org/download)


See [The dub file](dub.json) for dependencies details.

```
cd ./drake
dub
```


_As of 11/11/15 the only external library utilized is [vibed](http://vibed.org/)_  



## Planned Features

- [ ] Log Chat history when told
- [ ] Yell at people for pasting directly into IRC and/or ping them with a link to gist
- [ ] Play "guess what? Chicken butt" ( Because why not? )
- [ ] Simple response when name is mentioned ( i.e. Display list of commands when "Drake help" is mentioned etc )

**Things I'd like to implement in the future**:

- [ ] Control via web panel?
- [ ] public stats via web panel?
